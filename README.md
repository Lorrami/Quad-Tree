# Quad Tree

Sorry for the not clean code, but Im really tired

**Includes**:  
* quad tree data struct 
* random 2D field generation  
* multithreading  
* visualization(rectangles and circles)  
* four patterns(Singleton, Factory, Facade, Bridge)   
* If you want to build a program, grab all .dll and folders from folder necessary_files and copy them into your working directory  
* use window frame(camera(view)) like rectangle for the iteration area
* use MouseWheel to scale the view, use LeftMouseButton to move the camera  
* use LAlt to hide the QuadTree greed and LCtrl to show it  
* **DON'T MINIMZE THE WINDOW USING MINIMIZE BUTTON BECAUSE PROGRAM WILL CRASH(DAMN WINDOWKIT)**
